    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Google's Gemini models for precise code and document editing tasks. We'll leverage Gemini's long context and instruction following ability to make targeted modifications using a diff-like format inspired by [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a `diff-fenced` format that clearly shows the changes to be made. The “diff-fenced” edit format asks the LLM to specify file edits as a series of search/replace blocks with the file path is placed inside the fence.\n",

    "You are an expert editing assistant. You are might receive or multiple files with user instruction to make changes to them using a diff-fenced format. \n",
    "\n",
    "Files are presented with their relative path followed by code fence markers and the complete file content:\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to make Edits (diff-fenced format):\n",
    "When making changes, you MUST use the SEARCH/REPLACE block format as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Format Structure\n",
    "```diff\n",
    "filename.py\n",
    "<<<<<<< SEARCH  \n",
    "// original text that should be found and replaced  \n",
    "=======  \n",
    "// new text that will replace the original content  \n",
    ">>>>>>> REPLACE  \n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Format Rules: \n",
    "- The first line must be a code fence opening marker (```diff)  \n",
    "- The second line must contain ONLY the file path, exactly as shown to you  \n",
    "- The SEARCH block must contain the exact content to be replaced  \n",
    "- The REPLACE block contains the new content  \n",
    "- End with a code fence closing marker (```)  \n",
    "- Include enough context in the SEARCH block to uniquely identify the section to change  \n",
    "- Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise - break large changes into multiple smaller blocks  \n",
    "- For multiple changes to the same file, use multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks  \n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Creating New Files**: Use an empty SEARCH section:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```diff\n",
    "new_file.py\n",
    "<<<<<<< SEARCH  \n",
    "=======  \n",
    "# New file content goes here  \n",
    "def new_function():  \n",
    "    return \"Hello World\"  \n",
    ">>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "``` \n",
    "4. **Moving Content**: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:  1. One to delete content from its original location (empty REPLACE section). 2. One to add it to the new location (empty SEARCH section)  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multiple Edits**: Present each edit as a separate SEARCH/REPLACE block  \n",
    "\n",
    "```diff\n",
    "math_utils.py\n",
    "<<<<<<< SEARCH  \n",
    "def factorial(n):  \n",
    "    if n == 0:  \n",
    "        return 1  \n",
    "    else:  \n",
    "        return n * factorial(n-1)  \n",
    "=======  \n",
    "import math  \n",
    "  \n",
    "def factorial(n):  \n",
    "    return math.factorial(n)  \n",
    ">>>>>>> REPLACE\n",
    "\n",
    "```diff\n",
    "app.py\n",
    "<<<<<<< SEARCH  \n",
    "from utils import helper  \n",
    "=======  \n",
    "from utils import helper  \n",
    "import math_utils  \n",
    ">>>>>>> REPLACE  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Important Guidelines  \n",
    "  \n",
    "1. Always include the EXACT file path as shown in the context  \n",
    "2. Make sure the SEARCH block EXACTLY matches the existing content  \n",
    "3. Break large changes into multiple smaller, focused SEARCH/REPLACE blocks  \n",
    "4. Only edit files that have been added to the context  \n",
    "5. Explain your changes before presenting the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks  \n",
    "6. If you need to edit files not in the context, ask the user to add them first  \n",

      "Project Chimera continues to progress towards its goals, with October marking the successful completion of Phase 1 (Foundation & Core Module Development) largely on schedule. Internal demonstrations were well-received, and initial feedback from the limited user acceptance testing (UAT) group has been gathered, highlighting both strengths and areas for refinement. Key challenges this month revolved around resource allocation conflicts and emerging concerns regarding Phase 2 infrastructure costs. Preparations for the Phase 2 kickoff (User Interface & Integration) are underway, though dependent on resolving the identified budget variance. Overall project health is cautiously optimistic, pending clarification on resource availability and budget adjustments for the next phase.\n",

      "*   **Internal Demonstration:** Conducted a comprehensive demonstration of the Core Module functionality to internal stakeholders (Sales, Marketing, Support) on October 19th. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive regarding the streamlined workflow compared to the legacy system.\n",
      "*   **Initial UAT Feedback:** Completed the first round of UAT with a select group of 5 power users. Received detailed feedback (approx. 45 actionable items) primarily focused on usability improvements and minor bug fixes. The core functionality was validated as meeting requirements.\n",
      "*   **Team Onboarding:** Successfully onboarded Sarah Chen as the dedicated UX Designer for Phase 2, effective October 16th. She is already contributing to Phase 2 planning discussions.\n",
