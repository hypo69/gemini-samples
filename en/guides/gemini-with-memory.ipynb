    "# Integrating Long-Term Memory with Gemini 2.5\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, large language models (LLMs) are stateless, which means they do not remember past conversations. This can make it difficult to create truly personal and helpful AI applications. This guide shows you how to add long-term memory to your Gemini 2.5 chatbot using the Gemini API and [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0). \n",
    "\n",
    "By adding a memory system, your chatbot can:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Remember details about the user from past conversations.\n",
    "*   Give answers that are more relevant and personal.\n",
    "*   Stop asking the same questions over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use `mem0`, an open-source tool for giving AI agents long-term memory and Gemini 2.5 Flash as the LLM. We will build a simple chatbot that saves what you talk about and uses that history to give you better, more personalized answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does Mem0 work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mem0 is designed to equip AI agents with scalable long-term memory, effectively addressing the limitations of fixed context windows in LLMs. At its core, mem0 works by reactively extracting, consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is split into four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract salient information from conversations using an LLM with dual context (a conversation summary combined with recent messages).\n",
    "2. Use LLM to process context and extract important new information and compares them against existing ones using semantic similarity.\n",
    "3. Update Memory (ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, or NOOP), for Mem0g variant (graph), extract entities and relationships.\n",
    "4. Use vector similarity search to fetch relevant memories for response generation.\n",
    " \n",
    "It uses vector embeddings to store and retrieve semantic information, maintaining user-specific context across sessions, and implementing efficient retrieval mechanisms for relevant past interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we need to install the Mem0 library and the Gemini API client."

    "\n",
    "*   **LLM:** This model is responsible for processing the conversation, understanding the content, and extracting key information to be stored as memories.\n",
    "*   **Embedding Model:** This model takes the extracted text memories and converts them into numerical representations (vectors). This allows `mem0` to efficiently search and retrieve relevant memories based on their meaning when you ask a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use Google's Gemini models for both tasks. We will use `gemini-2.5-flash` as our LLM and `text-embedding-004` as our embedding model. We are going to use a local Qdrant instance as our vector store. Mem0 supports multiple vector stores incuding MongoDB, OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, Pgvector and more. "

It's a thrilling story of a lone astronaut on a mission to save humanity, filled with clever problem-solving and scientific detail. As for tech non-fiction, given your professional background, you might find The Age of AI: And Our Human Future by Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher to be a thought-provoking read.

      "This is a great idea to subtly weave in your personal interests! The mountain climbing/exploration theme is a perfect fit for discussing the challenges and future prospects of a complex, evolving field like Agentic AI.\n",

      "Here are a few options for your talk title and a corresponding key visual idea:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Option 1: Emphasizing Progress & Ambition**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Proposed Title:** **\"The Agentic Ascent: Scaling New Heights in Enterprise AI\"**\n",
      "    *   **Why it works:** \"Ascent\" and \"Scaling New Heights\" directly draw from your interest in climbing and the mountain metaphor, while clearly stating the core topic. It conveys a sense of progress, ambition, and looking towards the future.\n",
      "*   **Key Visual Idea:**\n",
      "    *   **Concept:** A stylized, majestic mountain peak, but instead of rock and snow, it's intricately formed from glowing, interconnected data lines, circuit board traces, or abstract geometric shapes that evoke AI's complexity and digital nature.\n",
      "    *   **Details:** Imagine a \"digital Everest.\" At the very top, there's a subtle, almost ethereal glow, perhaps radiating from a stylized, abstract \"agent\" icon or a converging point of the data lines, symbolizing the pinnacle of agentic AI. The base of the mountain could subtly transition into an abstract representation of an enterprise environment – perhaps subtle building outlines, network connections, or a grid pattern suggesting a corporate landscape. The background could be a gradient of deep blues and purples, with subtle wisps of \"data clouds\" or a digital aurora, emphasizing the futuristic and innovative nature. A digital sun could be subtly rising behind the peak, casting a hopeful glow.\n",
      "    *   **Color Palette:** Dominant cool tones (blues, greens, purples) accented with vibrant, electric highlights (teals, light blues, golds) for the glowing elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Option 2: Highlighting Navigation & Responsibility**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Proposed Title:** **\"Navigating the AI Peaks: Responsible Agentic Systems in the Enterprise\"**\n",
      "    *   **Why it works:** \"Navigating the AI Peaks\" speaks to the journey and challenges (tying into your \"Hurdles\" section and the \"Endurance\" book), while explicitly calling out \"Responsible\" AI, which is a key focus for you.\n",
      "*   **Key Visual Idea:**\n",
      "    *   **Concept:** A dramatic, but clean, visual of a winding path or series of interconnected pathways leading up a prominent, futuristic-looking mountain.\n",
      "    *   **Details:** The \"pathways\" themselves could be glowing data streams or secure network lines, symbolizing the structured deployment of AI. Along the path, subtle icons could hint at challenges or checkpoints (e.g., a faint \"question mark\" for evaluation, a \"shield\" for security). At the very summit, a stylized, balanced scale or a gentle, guiding light could represent \"responsible\" AI. The mountain itself would still be composed of tech-inspired elements (circuitry, data points). The background could show a deep, thoughtful twilight sky, perhaps with a distant, glowing \"enterprise city\" at the base of the mountain, showing the destination of this responsible development.\n",
      "    *   **Color Palette:** Slightly darker blues and purples, with contrasting greens or oranges for the glowing path, to imply a thoughtful and diligent journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "Both options allow you to subtly connect to your interests in mountain climbing, exploration, and overcoming challenges, while directly addressing the professional topic of Agentic AI in the Enterprise. Choose the one that best reflects the overall tone you want for your talk – more ambitious and forward-looking (Option 1) or more focused on the journey and ethical considerations (Option 2).\n"
