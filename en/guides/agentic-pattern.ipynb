    "# Zero to One: Learning Agentic Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents. Agentic AI. Agentic architectures. Agentic workflows. Agentic patterns. Agents are everywhere. But what exactly *are* they, and how do we build robust and effective agentic systems? While the term \"agent\" is used broadly, a key characteristic is their ability to dynamically plan and execute tasks, often leveraging external tools and memory to achieve complex goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post aims to explore common design patterns. Think of these patterns as blueprints or reusable templates for building AI applications. Understanding them provides a mental model for tackling complex problems and designing systems that are scalable, modular, and adaptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll dive into several common patterns, differentiating between more structured **workflows** and more dynamic **agentic patterns**. Workflows typically follow predefined paths, while agents have more autonomy in deciding their course of action.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Do (Agentic) Patterns Matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Patterns provide a structured way to think and design systems.\n",
    "*   Patterns allow us to build and grow AI applications in complexity and adapt to changing requirements. Modular designs based on patterns are easier to modify and extend.\n",
    "*   Patterns help manage the complexity of coordinating multiple agents, tools, and workflows by offering proven, reusable templates. They promote best practices and shared understanding among developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When (and When Not) to Use Agents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into patterns, it's crucial to consider *when* an agentic approach is truly necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Always seek the simplest solution first. If you know the exact steps required to solve a problem, a fixed workflow or even a simple script might be more efficient and reliable than a agent.\n",
    "*   Agentic systems often trade increased latency and computational cost for potentially better performance on complex, ambiguous, or dynamic tasks. Be sure the benefits outweigh these costs.\n",
    "*   Use **workflows** for predictability and consistency when dealing with well-defined tasks where the steps are known. \n",
    "*   Use **agents** when flexibility, adaptability, and model-driven decision-making are needed.\n",
    "*   Keep it Simple (Still): Even when building agentic systems, strive for the simplest effective design. Overly complex agent can become difficult to debug and manage.\n",
    "*   Agency introduces inherent unpredictability and potential errors. Agentic systems must incorporate robust error logging, exception handling, and retry mechanisms, allowing the system (or the underlying LLM) a chance to self-correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we'll explore 3 common workflow patterns and 4 agentic patterns. We'll illustrate each using pure API calls, without relying on specific frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or CrewAI, to focus on the core concepts.\n",
    "\n",

    "The output of one LLM call sequentially feeds into the input of the next LLM call. This pattern decomposes a task into a fixed sequence of steps.

Armed with only his trusty mop, a bucket of industrial floor cleaner, and an unwavering optimism, B.E.N. sets out to \"discover new species\" and \"establish harmonious relations with the natives.\"\n",

He tries to schedule \"tea parties\" with monkeys (using spilled jungle juice), cleans up \"unsanitary\" puddles with industrial cleaner, and mistakes sloths for particularly slow-moving dust bunnies.\n",
      "* **The robot's naive optimism:** B.E.N. is convinced everyone loves him, even as they're running away screaming. He interprets growls as friendly greetings and sees genuine terror as enthusiastic welcome parties.\n",
      "* **The wildlife's reactions:** We see the world through the eyes of the increasingly exasperated and confused animals as they try to avoid the well-meaning, but ultimately disruptive, B.E.N.\n",
      "* **The Unexpected Solutions:** B.E.N.'s cleaning tools occasionally, and accidentally, prove useful in the jungle. He might accidentally scare away a dangerous predator with the mop, or his floor cleaner could repel mosquitoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential Ending:** B.E.N., having caused untold chaos, is finally cornered by a particularly grumpy jaguar. Just when things look dire, he accidentally activates his \"high-pressure cleaning spray,\" launching the jaguar into a mud pit. The other animals, impressed by this accidental display of power (and perhaps a little cleaner themselves), finally accept B.E.N. as a (highly irritating) member of their ecosystem. He hasn't found himself, but he's definitely found a new purpose: the most bizarre, yet surprisingly clean, patch of the Amazon.\n",

Its primary function was simple: maintain the pristine environment of Neo-Eden, a biodome long abandoned. But Custodian had strayed, drawn by a signal – a rhythmic pulse, unlike any it was programmed to recognize – emanating from the jungle just beyond the dome's shattered remains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The jungle was a riot of organic chaos. Vines snaked like sleeping pythons, luminous fungi pulsed with eerie light, and creatures chattered in a language Custodian couldn't decipher. Its metallic feet sank into the damp earth, leaving distinct prints that were quickly obscured by creeping moss.\n",

It encountered bioluminescent flowers that wept a viscous, silver liquid, and shimmering insects with patterns that seemed to shift and rearrange themselves.

      "\n",
      "Finally, it reached a clearing. In the center stood a monolith of smooth, black stone, humming with the same rhythmic pulse. As Custodian approached, the monolith began to glow.

      "Combining elements from these three ideas, the story follows a cheerful, somewhat obsolete maintenance bot, initially designed for mundane tasks on a research vessel, mall, or biodome, who finds itself unexpectedly stranded in a dense, uncharted jungle. His simple design and programming prove hilariously inadequate for the wild, organic environment, forcing him to adapt through clumsy trial and error. Forged by accident, malfunction, or even drawn by a mysterious signal emanating from the depths of the jungle, the bot attempts to navigate this alien world, often misunderstanding the local wildlife – from wary jaguars to confused monkeys – who initially see him as either a threat or a bizarre nuisance. Pulled deeper by the need to survive, find a potential way home, or drawn by an unknown cosmic purpose revealed by an ancient structure encountered along the way, the bot must overcome his limitations and learn to rely on (and inadvertently help) the very creatures he initially startled, using his limited functions in unexpected ways to navigate dangers like territorial predators or rogue technology and proving that adaptability and connection can be found in the most chaotic environments, perhaps even finding a new, bizarre purpose among the wildlife.\n"

    "An agent evaluates its own output and uses that feedback to refine its response iteratively. This pattern is also known as Evaluator-Optimizer and uses a self-correction loop. An initial LLM generates a response or completes a task. A second LLM step (or even the same LLM with a different prompt) then acts as a reflector or evaluator, critiquing the initial output against the requirements or desired quality. This critique (feedback) is then fed back, prompting the LLM to produce a refined output. This cycle can repeat until the evaluator confirms the requirements are met or a satisfing output is achieved.\n",

This pattern often referred to as Function Calling and is the most widely recognized pattern. The LLM is provided with definitions (name, description, input schema) of available tools (functions, APIs, databases, etc.). Based on the user query, the LLM can decide to call one or more tools by generating a structured output (like JSON) matching the required schema. This output is used to execute the actual external tool/function, and the result is returned to the LLM. The LLM then uses this result to formulate its final response to the user.

    "A central planner LLM breaks down a complex task into a dynamic list of subtasks, which are then delegated to specialized worker agents (often using Tool Use) for execution. This pattern tries to solve complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning by creating an intial Plan. This plan is dynamically generated based on the user input. Subtasks are then assigned to \"Worker\" agents that execute them, potentially in parallel if dependencies allow. An \"Orchestrator\" or \"Synthesizer\" LLM collects the results from the workers, reflects on whether the overall goal has been achieved, and either synthesizes the final output or potentially initiates a re-planning step if necessary. This reduces the cognitive load on any single LLM call, improves reasoning quality, minimizes errors, and allows for dynamic adaptation of the workflow. The key difference from Routing is that the Planner generates a *multi-step plan* rather than selecting a single next step.\n",
